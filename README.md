# React Calculator
This project is a simple calculator demo built using react. The purpose of this project was to practice my react skills while building an aesthetic project. Many of the components such as calculator buttons are from ant-design.

To test out the calculator for yourself, simple go to [this link](https://adrianthehacker.github.io/react-calculator/).
